* Free Yourself from your ORM with MyPy

I am Thomas Stephens, a full-stack developer at uStudio.

* Why are ORMs Bad?

They couple your application code to your database.

They hide your queries behind opaque interfaces.

Their behavior can sometimes be unexpected and dangerous.

* Why are ORMs Good?

They abstract your code from the DB interface.

They can provide higher level interfaces to your database.

They can enforce a schema at the application level.

Simple patterns can be built very easily.

* What alternatives are there?

Functional Composition -> f(g(x))

Built in data structures

"Bare" classes.

* What is MyPy?

It has nothing to do with databases.

It's a static type checker.

* Let's try it out!
